Descriptions:

* [archive] The traditional super easy archive is back!
* [monorsa] Huge prime numbers are key to secure encryptions.
* [bcrypt] Flag got encrypted with extremely secure bcrypt, and for even more security every letter got encrypted separately.
* [rna rng] We believe Alice's device has bad RNG. We intercepted a lot of public keys from other users of same device. Maybe that's of some help? #realistic
* [python] Very simple python password validator.
* [multirna] Factoring is hard, so having more primes in your key will make it even more secure, right?
* [validator] Challenging binary to reverse (Linux and OSX versions of same program).
* [svg xor] SVG file containing the flag was encrypted with XOR cipher.
* [FPGA] Password validator is now in hardware. At least we found emulator and netlist.
* [tweets] Secret Agent Comrade Donald T. hid secret message among his tweets, and used monoalphabetic emoji encryption.
